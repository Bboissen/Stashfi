## 🔎 Overview (TL;DR)
Stashfi is an on-chain spot trading & strategy layer: limit / stop / stop-limit + DCA & value-averaging schedulers.

Once the core smart contracts are deployed, it expands into a performance-aligned marketplace where quants publish auditable strategies users can follow while funds remain in their own wallets or vaults.

## 💡 Why It Should Exists
Centralized exchanges = counterparty & rehypothecation risk.<br>
Typical DEX UX = Uniswap V3 with no innovation.<br>
Stashfi bridges the gap: advanced controls + transparent, performance‑based incentives

## 🚀 Core Feature Set
| Domain | Features |
|--------|----------|
| Orders | Limit • Stop • Stop‑Limit • Trailing |
| Automation | DCA scheduler • Value averaging planner |
| Strategies | Publish / subscribe marketplace • On‑chain performance tracking |
| Fees | Performance‑aligned (e.g. high‑watermark / realized PnL based) |
| Risk | Global + per‑position safeguards (roadmap) |
| Education | Contextual inline tips • Lightweight explainer modals |

## 🛡️ Security & Trust Principles
1. Self‑custody first — minimize privileged roles.
2. Verifiable execution — triggers & fills are provable.
3. Economic alignment — bonded keepers & performance‑paid strategists.
4. Progressive decentralization — orchestration migrates on‑chain / DAO‑governed over time.
