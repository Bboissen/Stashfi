## 🐿️ Stashfi
**On‑chain smart trading & automated strategies for everyone.**

Bring CEX‑grade portfolio & risk tools (especially real stops) to the transparency and self‑custody of DeFi.

</div>

### TL;DR
Stashfi is an on‑chain spot trading & strategy layer: limit / stop / stop‑limit / DCA / value‑averaging + a performance‑aligned marketplace where quantitative strategists ("quants") publish automated strategies users can adopt without surrendering custody.

### Why It Matters
Centralized exchanges add counterparty risk; most DEXs lack advanced order & risk controls. Stashfi closes that gap while creating a fair incentive model (fees tied to strategy performance, not mere AUM or churn).

### Core Features (Initial Scope)
- Advanced Spot Orders: limit, stop, stop‑limit, trailing
- Automated Accumulation: DCA & value averaging schedulers
- Strategy Marketplace: publish, subscribe, monitor – all via transparent smart contracts
- Performance‑Aligned Fees: quants earn when users profit (e.g. high‑watermark or realized PnL based)
- Portfolio Safeguards: global and per‑position risk caps (roadmap)
- Education Layer: contextual tips & light explainer modals (kept decluttered)

### Security & Trust Principles
- Self‑custody first: contracts minimize privileged control.
- Transparent execution: verifiable triggers & fill proofs.
- Economically aligned keepers & strategists.
- Progressive decentralization of orchestration layer.

### Roadmap (Indicative)
- [ ] MVP: limit / stop / stop‑limit, DCA, value averaging - Q1 2026
- [ ] Strategy publishing & subscription flows
- [ ] Performance fee module (high‑watermark variant)
- [ ] Risk dashboard & global stop
- [ ] Trailing stops & conditional OCO bundles
- [ ] Cross‑venue routing / best execution
