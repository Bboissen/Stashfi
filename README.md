## 🔎 Overview
Stashfi is an on-chain spot trading and strategy layer designed to bring advanced, automated trading tools to DeFi. It begins with powerful order types and schedulers, and will evolve into a decentralized marketplace for algorithmic trading strategies.

## 💡 Why Stashfi?
Stashfi aims to bridge the gap between the feature-rich experience of centralized exchanges and the security of decentralized finance. We are building a trust-minimized environment with transparent, performance-based incentives for all participants.

## 🚀 Core Features
- **Advanced Trading Tools**: Go beyond simple swaps with limit, stop, and trailing orders.
- **Automated Investing**: Implement systematic strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and value averaging.
- **Strategy Marketplace**: Discover, follow, and publish on-chain trading strategies.
- **Aligned Incentives**: A performance-based fee structure ensures strategists succeed when you do.

## 🛡️ Security & Trust Principles
1. **Self-Custody First**: Minimize privileged roles and ensure users control their funds.
2. **Verifiable Execution**: All trades and triggers are provable on-chain.
3. **Economic Alignment**: Incentivize participants through bonding and performance-based fees.
4. **Progressive Decentralization**: Gradually move orchestration and governance on-chain.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
Our development is planned in phases:

- **Phase 1: Core Trading Features**
  - Implementation of advanced order types (limit, stop, trailing stops).
  - Automated schedulers for DCA and value averaging strategies.

- **Phase 2: Strategy Marketplace**
  - Launch the platform for publishing and subscribing to trading strategies.
  - Implement on-chain performance tracking and a transparent fee module.

- **Phase 3: Advanced Functionality & Decentralization**
  - Introduce sophisticated risk management tools and enhanced order types.
  - Transition core protocol governance to a decentralized model.

> This roadmap is directional and subject to change based on audit outcomes and community feedback.
